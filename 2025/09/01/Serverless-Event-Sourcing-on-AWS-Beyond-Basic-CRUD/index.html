    <div class="body">
      <p>When you order something online, a lot happens — order created, payment confirmed, address updated, shipped, delivered. But if the system only stores the final state, you&rsquo;d know it was delivered but lose the story of how it got there. That&rsquo;s the limitation of traditional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete): it shows the present but erases the past.</p>
<p>Event Sourcing flips that model. Every change is stored as an immutable event, giving you a complete, replayable history — like a bank ledger instead of just today&rsquo;s balance. This means better auditing, debugging, analytics, and the ability to evolve your system without rewriting history.</p>
<p>And with AWS services like DynamoDB, EventBridge, and Lambda, event sourcing fits naturally into the serverless, event-driven world, where scalability and cost-efficiency are built in.</p>
<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll explore how to move beyond basic CRUD and design serverless event-sourced systems on AWS — unlocking capabilities that CRUD can&rsquo;t deliver.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-event-sourcing">What is Event Sourcing?</h2>
<p>At its core, Event Sourcing is about storing events instead of just state. Instead of updating a record to reflect the latest value, every change is captured as a new, immutable event.</p>
<p>Think of it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a CRUD system, an order table might just show <code>status = &quot;Shipped&quot;</code></li>
<li>In an event-sourced system, you&rsquo;d see a timeline:
<ul>
<li><code>OrderCreated</code></li>
<li><code>OrderPaid</code></li>
<li><code>OrderShipped</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The current state can always be reconstructed by replaying these events, but the real power lies in the history. You can answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did this order change status?</li>
<li>Who made the update?</li>
<li>What was the system state at a specific point in time?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.sidathm.online/images/posts/Serverless-Event-Sourcing-on-AWS-Beyond-Basic-CRUD/what-is-event-sourcing.webp" alt="Image description"></p>
<p>This approach turns your database into a source of truth for the past, present, and future. You can not only see what happened, but also replay events to rebuild projections, feed analytics pipelines, or even drive new features without touching existing data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Event Sourcing is not just about data storage — it&rsquo;s about preserving the story of your system.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="designing-an-event-sourced-system-on-aws">Designing an Event-Sourced System on AWS</h2>
<p>Designing event sourcing comes down to two core questions: how do you store events, and how do you use them?</p>
<p>On AWS, a common approach is to use DynamoDB as the event store. Since events are usually unstructured or vary over time, DynamoDB&rsquo;s schemaless design makes it a natural fit. Every new change in the system is appended to this table as an immutable event.</p>
<p>From there, AWS Lambda acts as the consumer. By enabling DynamoDB Streams, you can automatically trigger a Lambda whenever new events are written. This means your application can react to changes in near real time — for example, updating projections, sending notifications, or publishing to an event bus.</p>
<p>In the diagram below, events arrive through a REST API exposed via API Gateway. The API writes them into the DynamoDB event store. Each new entry then flows through the DynamoDB Stream → Lambda consumer, which processes the event.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*vftZJXGV0TxW_R1HEMJHHA.png" alt="Image description"></p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a challenge. In an event-sourced system, the database doesn&rsquo;t store the final state — only the sequence of events. To answer a simple question like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the current status of this order?&rdquo;, you&rsquo;d have to replay all past events for that aggregate. Doing this repeatedly is both inefficient and expensive.</p>
<p>This is where the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern comes in. With CQRS, you separate writes from reads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writes still go to the DynamoDB event store.</li>
<li>Reads no longer query the event store directly. Instead, the Lambda consumer takes each event and updates a separate read-optimized database (for example, another DynamoDB table, OpenSearch index, or even Aurora).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*7rsb35TRCG9i1RRTxbyaHg.png" alt="Image description"></p>
<p>This read model looks like a traditional transactional database — fast, queryable, and easy to consume. Clients now query this projection for the latest state, while the event store continues to capture the full history.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>The event store preserves the truth of what happened.</li>
<li>The read model gives you quick answers to what is.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining Event Sourcing + CQRS, you get the best of both worlds: complete historical traceability and efficient real-time reads.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-event-sourcing">Benefits of Event Sourcing</h2>
<p>Event sourcing isn&rsquo;t just about storing data differently — it unlocks capabilities that traditional CRUD models struggle with.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*h9sUfSBlxoemdJoiBCKbVg.jpeg" alt="Image description"></p>
<h3 id="1-complete-audit-trail">1. Complete Audit Trail</h3>
<p>Every event is preserved, giving you a full history of what happened, when, and by whom (ex. finance domain). This makes compliance, debugging, and forensics far easier than with systems that only store the latest state.</p>
<h3 id="2-replayability--recovery">2. Replayability &amp; Recovery</h3>
<p>Since events are immutable, you can replay them at any time to rebuild projections or recover from failures. If a read model gets corrupted, just clear it and replay the event stream to restore it.</p>
<h3 id="3-temporal-queries">3. Temporal Queries</h3>
<p>CRUD can only answer &ldquo;What is the state now?&rdquo;. Event sourcing lets you ask &ldquo;What was the state at this point in time?&rdquo;. For example, you can see what an order looked like yesterday at 3 PM or trace how it evolved over time.</p>
<h3 id="4-flexibility--extensibility">4. Flexibility &amp; Extensibility</h3>
<p>New features often require new ways of looking at data. With event sourcing, you don&rsquo;t have to redesign your schema — just build a new projection by replaying existing events. This allows you to evolve the system without rewriting history.</p>
<h3 id="5-natural-fit-for-event-driven-architectures">5. Natural Fit for Event-Driven Architectures</h3>
<p>Event sourcing aligns perfectly with modern, serverless, event-driven systems. Events can be published to an event bus (like Amazon EventBridge) and consumed by multiple independent services without tight coupling.</p>
<h2 id="challenges--trade-offs">Challenges &amp; Trade-offs</h2>
<p>While event sourcing is powerful, it&rsquo;s not without its complexities. Before adopting it, teams should carefully weigh the trade-offs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Complexity</strong> — Storing, ordering, and replaying events requires additional infrastructure compared to simple CRUD. You&rsquo;ll need to design for schema evolution, versioning, and event serialization.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Growth</strong> — Events are immutable and accumulate indefinitely. Without compaction strategies or snapshots, storage can grow rapidly.</li>
<li><strong>Eventual Consistency</strong> — Since state is derived from replayed events, read models often lag behind writes. Systems need to tolerate eventual consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging &amp; Monitoring</strong> — Tracing issues across a long chain of events can be harder than inspecting a single row in a database.</li>
<li><strong>Learning Curve</strong> — Teams used to CRUD-based systems may need time to adapt to event-driven thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, event sourcing unlocks powerful capabilities like auditing, traceability, and replay — but comes with operational overhead and design challenges that need to be managed with care.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-or-avoid-event-sourcing">When to Use or Avoid Event Sourcing</h2>
<p>Event Sourcing is powerful, but it&rsquo;s not always the right tool. You should consider it when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong auditability is required</strong> — If your system needs a complete, immutable log of every change (e.g., banking, healthcare, compliance-heavy domains).</li>
<li><strong>Business processes depend on history</strong> — When past states or detailed change history matter (e.g., dispute resolution, fraud detection, analytics).</li>
<li><strong>High scalability is needed</strong> — Event-driven systems can scale horizontally more easily than traditional CRUD-based systems.</li>
<li><strong>CQRS and microservices are in play</strong> — Event sourcing naturally complements CQRS, projections, and event-driven microservices.</li>
<li><strong>Future-proofing</strong> — Storing raw events allows you to build new projections, analytics, or features later without changing how data was originally recorded.</li>
</ul>
<p>When to avoid it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the system is simple (CRUD suffices).</li>
<li>If the operational overhead of managing event stores, replay logic, and projections outweighs the benefits.</li>
<li>If teams lack experience with distributed/event-driven architectures.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: use Event Sourcing when auditability, scalability, and flexibility outweigh the complexity.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Event Sourcing brings a powerful way of modeling applications by treating state changes as a sequence of immutable events. It enables auditability, flexibility, and scalability, making it a natural fit for modern cloud-native architectures on AWS. However, it also comes with challenges such as event ordering, schema evolution, and operational complexity that require careful design.</p>
<p>When applied in the right context — such as systems needing strong audit trails, historical state reconstruction, or real-time insights — Event Sourcing can significantly elevate the reliability and adaptability of your applications.</p>
<p>In short, Event Sourcing isn&rsquo;t about replacing CRUD everywhere. It&rsquo;s about choosing the right paradigm for the right problem. By combining Event Sourcing with supporting patterns like CQRS, and leveraging AWS services like DynamoDB, EventBridge, Kinesis, and Lambda, teams can build event-driven systems that are both resilient and future-ready.</p>
