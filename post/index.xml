      <description>Kubernetes has quickly become the leading orchestration tool for containerized applications, celebrated for its ability to scale applications robustly and resiliently. Its success lies in a powerful framework that adeptly handles the complex life cycles of distributed applications. Yet, deploying Kubernetes cluster infrastructure, essential for tapping into this platform’s capabilities, presents significant challenges. This complexity requires considerable effort and poses a major hurdle for many seeking to leverage Kubernetes for scalable application deployment.</description>

      <description>In the fast-paced realm of software development, agility and adaptability are not just a virtue but a necessity. Feature flagging is a versatile technique that offers a strategic approach for releasing features to end users, enabling rapid software development while giving more control to teams to evolve products.
Feature flags decouple feature deployment from code deployment, allowing teams to release features incrementally and independently. Due to this, teams can do frequent code deployments darkly, although the entire feature development is incomplete.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the continuously evolving landscape of web applications, real-time communication has become the gold standard for creating engaging and interactive user experiences. Whether you’re building a chat application, a collaborative online game, or a live dashboard, WebSocket technology has emerged as the enchanting solution that makes real-time magic happen. And when it comes to unleashing the full potential of WebSockets in a serverless and scalable manner, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has a spell of its own — AWS API Gateway.</description>

      <description>Introduction GitHub Actions is a platform to perform automated tasks upon triggering an event in GitHub. This is being used extensively to govern continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows once code changes are pushed to a repository. But GitHub Actions has capabilities beyond that to automate a lot of stuff such as tagging releases, sending notifications when creating issues, repository migrations, etc.
Why you should use GitHub Actions for CI/CD?</description>

      <description>Introduction The heart of any software solution is its infrastructure and administering it appropriately is very crucial. At present, it can be seen that the majority of software vendors have moved towards using cloud platforms and serverless architectures to mitigate the complexity of maintaining infrastructure. Still, things like provisioning the infrastructure in diverse environments and keeping them in sync need enormous effort if done manually.
This challenge can be eased by a practice known as Infrastructure as code (IaC) that codifies and manages underlying IT infrastructure.</description>
